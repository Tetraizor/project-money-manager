# ðŸ’²Project Money ManagerðŸ’²

This is a React project (possibly native) that's currently in development, with the main goal of keeping track of your expenses and gains over the month. The name is subject to change, obviously.

## ðŸ“ŒWhat I plan to add

- **Keeping track of your expenses.** This could be the monthly (or in any time span you like) expenses you regularly pay; like bills, subscriptions, etc.
- **Setting a saving goal.** By setting a goal users will be able to see how their amount compares with the goal they set.
- **Working multiplatform.** My eventual goal with this project is to teach myself the basics of React. So one of the most important things is to make this app cross-platform. I'm not thinking of Desktop apps but apps that are reactive to every resolution in browsers, and possibly a native Mobile app.
- **Syncing data between devices with personal accounts.** If this app's going to be multiplatform, it's essential to sync data between different devices. So I'll be implementing a couple of authentication methods to register, login, and sync your data. Not sure my $5-per-month Linux server can handle this, but I'll still try.

## âŒ›Current state of the project

I'll be trying to add future goals, a section to track my current progress, and such if I'll have the time. **Thank you!**
